## 🔬 PCBPN013-WG Datasheet

### General Information
* **Product:** PCBPN013-WG Boroscopic probe
* **Description:** Boroscopic probe for $1/3^{\prime\prime}$ detectors, probe diameter 7 mm
* **Key Advantages:**
    * Inspection of cavities from inside
    * Hidden internal features and defects are clearly viewed
    * High resolution
    * Catadioptric design enables the detection of tiny defects over a very wide view angle
    * Flaw detection
    * Coarse deformations revealed using direct illumination
    * Surface defect enhancement by mixing direct and indirect illumination
    * Small diameter inspection, now down to 5.5 mm
* **Application:** Used to inspect holed objects like engine parts, containers, and tubes where hidden features require a probe inside the cavity.
* **Patented:** Yes
* **Standards/Compliance:** CE, ROHS, REACH
* **Version Date:** November 17, 2025
